## Summary
In this project I learned how to use canvas and build Java Script based games

With the new year approaching, I'd like to expand my profile which describes my programming skills to include wider and diverse capabilities. Ultimately, my goal is to land a job which incorporates these multiple skills. I would also like to demonstrate my abilities and wide knowledge of the craft. 
Therefore, I have begun revising the site and adding apps to my GitHub repository. 

This is the first project in a series of many more to come where I'll provide recruiters and employers the opportunity to go over my code in a coherent and concise manner. I plan to build a comprehensive website, impress the viewer, enhance my skills and most importantly do what I love most, coding.
