## Summary

With the new year approaching, I'd like to expand my profile which describes my programming skills to include wider and diverse capabilities. Ultimately, my goal is to land a job which incorporates these multiple skills. I would also like to demonstrate my abilities and wide knowledge of the craft. 
Therefore, I have begun revising the site and adding apps to my GitHub repo.

This is the first project in a series of many more to come where I'll provide recruiters and employers the opportunity to go over my code in a coherent and concise manner. I plan to build a comprehensive website, impress the viewer, enhance my skills and most importantly do what I love most, coding. 
<br>
In this project I learned how to use canvas and build Java Script based games
