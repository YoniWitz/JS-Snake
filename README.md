## Summary
Towards the end of 2019 I realized it's not enough to rely on my programming skills to land the perfect job I love. I must also demonstrate to others my abilities and wide knowledge of the craft. 
As part of my effort, I started working on a profile website as well as add apps to my then quite empty GitHub repo. 
This is the first project in a series of many more to come where I'll provide recruiters and employers the opportunity to go over my code in an easy and enjoyable manner. My goal is to build a comprehensive website, impress the viewer, enhance my skills and most importantly do what I love most, coding.
